## Overview
This repo is our project "Streaming System Benchmark with Flink and Storm" in the course "Advanced Databases" at Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles (ULB). This project encompasses a comprehensive evaluation of streaming databases, focusing on Apache Flink and Apache Storm, and their comparative performance against a traditional relational database, specifically PostgreSQL.
